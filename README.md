Asleboon Dotfiles Repo

This repo includes my updated dotfiles.

## What are dotfiles? 
Dotfiles are configuration files for software on your computer.
Such as your terminal, editor, version control system etc.
A lot of software is dependent on configuration files living in the 

home directory (~). Using symlinks, we can have the files in our repo
and have symlinks in our home directory to make sure everything works
as expected.
